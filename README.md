# Advance React Example

With this example I'm implementing Isomorphic react to reduce rendering time, context API to allow me gain props without passing through multiple components, and optimising performance by checking if my components re-render every second if I implement timer that need to re-render.

By the time I finish this example using React 16.2. React 16.3 will have different implementation on Context API and still not recommened to use on production environment.

### Setup included:

- Webpack
- ESLint
- Lodash
- Node Server (Express) with PM2
- Test with Jest and Enzyme
- Babel
- Prod ready script

### React concept

- Async consume mock API
- Isomorphic React (Server rendering) and Client Render
- Nested Components
- Class components, Pure components, Functional components
- PropTypes
- StoreProvider concept using Context API (v16.2)
- Optimise performance by checking re-render
